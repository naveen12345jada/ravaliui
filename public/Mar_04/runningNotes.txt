Closures:

    function funname() { // definition
        ....
        ....
    }
    funname(); // Calling
    ----------------

    (function() { // Both defining an calling.
        ...
        ...
    })();

    1.  asssign a value or name to closure
    2. From the closure, return an object with all the prop and methods, which need to be accessable outside of closure
    3. Access the closure data outside of it, through the closure name
