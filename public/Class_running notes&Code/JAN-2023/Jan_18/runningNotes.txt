CSS Positions

    top 
    right
    bottom
    left

    using above 4 css properties, we could able to move any dom element to any required position without changing dimenstions of the dom element.

    The above 4 css properties can only be applied to the dom elements which are positioned with non static value.

-------------

Any dom element with position non static, will automatically move from default x, y axis to z axis.

-------------------------------
position: static/relative/absolute/fixed/sticky;

    position: static;
        1. By default every dom element rendering on the page has default css position as static.
        2. Means, the dom element cannot change its default position - It will not consider css positions like top, left, right or bottom properties.        
        3. It always falls under default x y axis
-----------------------------------------------------------

Position: relative;
    1. Element is capable of moving to any required position within the page.  (it considers css properties like top, left right and bottom )
    2. The relative element while moving to z axis, it doesnt loose its original space been occupied under x y axis.
