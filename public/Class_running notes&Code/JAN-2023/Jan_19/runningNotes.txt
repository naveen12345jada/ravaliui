Position absolute:
    1. Element is capable of moving to any position (it  considers top, left right and bottom properties)
    2. when its moving from x and y axis to z axis it is not going to hold its original position
    3. As it doesnt hold its original position, it always moves according to the position of its parent element
    4. While depending on the parent element position, it only depends on the parent element whose position is non static
    5. If parent or grand parent doesnt hold the position as non static, it depends on the body tag


z-index - 
    property, using we could control the z axis position of any dom elements which are rendering with in z axis
        it always a numeric value
            eg: z-index: 5;
