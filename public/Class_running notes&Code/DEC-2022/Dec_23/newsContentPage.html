        <h3>News Title 1:</h3> 
        <p>
            A new plan seems to be in place as newly elected party president Mallikarjun Kharge spoke out on the China issue. From comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a mouse to taunting the BJP by saying that not even “one of its dogs died” in the fight for freedom. Despite pressure from the BJP to apologise, Kharge has refused to back down, countering it with: “What is there to debate about a comment made outside Parliament?” In the Rajya Sabha, in fact, he repeated the argument — minus the dog analogy — that while Congress leaders died for India, the BJP and RSS “should tell us what they did in the freedom movement".
