    <h4>lyrics1</h4><pre> you're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight</pre>

<h4>lyrics2</h4><pre>I'm gonna hold you close
Make sure that you know
I was lost before you
Christmas was cold and grey
Another holiday alone to celebrate
But then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree</pre>

<h4 class="abc">lyrics3</h4><pre class="abc">You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree</pre>

<h4 class="abc">lyrics4</h4><pre class="abc">I found, what I was looking for
A love that's meant for me
A heart that's mine completely
Knocked me right off my feet
And this year I will fall
With no worries at all
'Cause you are near and everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree</pre>

<h4 class="abc">lyrics5</h4><pre class="abc">You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree</pre>

<h4 class="bcd">lyrics6</h4><pre class="bcd">And then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree</pre>

<h4 class="bcd"> lyrics7</h4><pre class="bcd"> you're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight (oh, you're all I need)
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (underneath the tree)
You're all that I need (underneath the tree, yeah)
Underneath the tree
Tonight
Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree, oh</pre>
