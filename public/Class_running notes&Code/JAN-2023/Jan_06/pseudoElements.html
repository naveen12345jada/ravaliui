            The rumours began after Vijay’s Wikipedia page claimed that he and Sangeetha have mutually decided to get a divorce. To top it off, a few fans also noticed that Sangeetha was missing from Atlee’s wife Priya’s baby shower and Varisu’s music launch. However, a source close to the couple told Pinkvilla that the divorce rumours are not true, adding that Sangeetha is holidaying in the US with the children and thus absent from recent events.
