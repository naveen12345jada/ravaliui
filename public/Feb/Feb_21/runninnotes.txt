Event handling 
    Event - > any action happens on the page is called an event (cclick, dblclick, hover, focus, keypress, keydown.)

    If we could invoke a job when a particular action happens on the page - its called evenbt handling


    Predefined event attributes:\
        onclick 
        onmouseove
        onfocus
        onblur 
        onchange
         ... 
         .. 
         .. 
         ..
